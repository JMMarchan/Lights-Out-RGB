# Lights-Out-RGB

A grid game where each square randomly starts red, green or blue, and when pressing a square, 
orthogonally adjacent squares become the colour they are not (i.e. if a square is red and an adjacent green square is selected, it turns blue). The goal of the game is to have all squares be the same colour. Currently unknown if possible, thus creating game to test out possibility.
